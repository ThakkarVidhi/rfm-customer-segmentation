## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThakkarVidhi/rfm-customer-segmentation.git
    cd rfm-customer-segmentation
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the database and run the app:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to start using the application.

## Usage

To run the RFM analysis, follow these steps:

1. Upload your CSV file containing customer data (with columns: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country).
2. Select the appropriate file and click "Analyze".
3. View the segmentation results and explore the interactive charts.

## Configuration

This project uses a `config.py` file for managing application settings and paths. The configuration file contains the following settings:

### Configuration Settings:

- `BASE_DIR`: The absolute path to the base directory of the project.
- `STATIC_DIR`: Path to the static directory used to serve static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images).
- `INPUT_DATA_DIR`: Path to the directory where input data (e.g., CSV files) is stored.
- `TEMPLATE_DIR`: Path to the directory containing HTML templates for the application.
- `MODEL_PATH`: Path to the saved machine learning model used for customer segmentation.
- `DEBUG`: Set to `True` for enabling debugging during development.

## FAQs

**Q: What data format is required for upload?**  
**A:** CSV files with columns for `InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`, `Description`, `Quantity`, `InvoiceDate`, `UnitPrice`, `CustomerID`, and `Country`.

**Q: How can I modify the applicationâ€™s configuration?**  
**A:** The configuration can be modified by editing the `config.py` file. You can change the paths and other settings like `DEBUG`.

**Q: What should I do if the application is not displaying correctly?**  
**A:** Make sure the required directories and files are in place. Check the browser's developer tools for errors, and verify that the paths in `config.py` are correct.

**Q: Can I use a different machine learning model for segmentation?**  
**A:** Yes, you can replace the model file (`customer_segmentation_model.pkl`) in the `app/models` directory with another compatible model as long as it follows the same format.
