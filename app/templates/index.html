                        <p>
                            This horizontal bar chart lists the top 10 products with the highest sales volume. Each bar corresponds to a specific product (with its description and stock code), and its length represents the total quantity sold.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Why is this useful?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Analyzing top-selling products gives you a clear picture of what drives the majority of your sales. This information is vital for:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ensuring you maintain sufficient stock levels to avoid shortages.</li>
                                <li>Identifying trends in customer preferences.</li>
                                <li>Focusing marketing efforts on popular products to further boost sales.</li>
                                <li>Developing new products that align with these high-demand items.</li>
                            </ul>
                            For example, if certain products have consistently high sales, you may want to feature them prominently in marketing campaigns or bundle them with slower-moving inventory to increase overall sales.

                            This horizontal bar chart highlights the top 10 products with the highest return rates. Each bar corresponds to a product, and its length represents the rate at which customers returned it.

                            Understanding return trends is crucial for identifying potential issues with your products or sales processes. High return rates could indicate:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Quality issues with the product (e.g., defects or misrepresentation).</li>
                                <li>Inaccurate or misleading product descriptions.</li>
                                <li>Customer dissatisfaction due to unmet expectations.</li>
                            </ul>
                            By identifying these products, you can take corrective action, such as improving quality control, revising product descriptions, or providing better support to customers.
